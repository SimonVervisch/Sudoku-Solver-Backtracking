# Basic implementation of sudoku algorithm (didactical purpose)


with
***
* Naive Implementation
* Backtracking Implementation



Built this sudoku solver to learn the backtracking principle. The naive implementation takes too much human time, but works. The backtracking implemenation takes around 5 seconds to computer a sudoku. This was a really interesting project
